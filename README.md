- Detects and displays modifier keys (`Ctrl`, `Shift`, `Alt`, `Meta/Cmd`, `Fn`) and their combinations (e.g. `Ctrl+X`)
- Blocks default browser and OS actions as much as possible for uninterrupted testing
- Responsive, minimal UI — works on desktop and mobile
- No dependencies, pure JavaScript and CSS
- Useful for developers to test keyboard layouts, shortcuts, and event properties
